# Quickstart

StartupJS is a full-stack framework for building real-time, cross-platform apps. It runs on web, iOS, and Android from a single codebase. Data syncs automatically between all connected clients using signals -- reactive pointers to your database.

## Prerequisites

**Node.js** -- version 22 or higher

```
brew install node
```

**Yarn** (optional but recommended)

If you prefer Yarn over npm, enable Corepack and activate Yarn 4:

```
corepack enable
```

> If `corepack` is not available, install it globally first: `npm install -g corepack`

> These commands use Homebrew on macOS. On other operating systems, follow each tool's official installation guide.

You do **not** need to install MongoDB or Redis for local development. StartupJS uses in-memory mocks by default. For production, see the [production setup](#production-setup) section below.

## Create a project

### 1. Create an Expo app

If using **Yarn** (recommended):

```bash
yarn create expo-app myapp
cd myapp
echo 'nodeLinker: node-modules' > .yarnrc.yml && corepack use yarn@4
```

If using **npm**:

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest myapp
cd myapp
```

### 2. Install StartupJS

```bash
npm init startupjs@latest
```

### 3. Fix dependency versions (temporary)

Add the following to your `package.json` to fix a known compatibility issue, then run `npm install` again:

If using **npm**:

```json
"overrides": {
  "sharedb-redis-pubsub": {
    ".": "2.0.1",
    "sharedb": "5.2.2"
  }
}
```

If using **Yarn**:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "sharedb-redis-pubsub": "2.0.1",
  "sharedb-redis-pubsub/sharedb": "5.2.2"
}
```

### 4. Wrap your root component

Open `app/_layout.tsx` and wrap your root component with `StartupjsProvider`:

```jsx
import { StartupjsProvider } from 'startupjs'

export default function RootLayout () {
  return (
    <StartupjsProvider>
      {/* your existing layout content */}
    </StartupjsProvider>
  )
}
```

### 5. Start the app

```bash
yarn start
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm start
```

The app opens in your browser. Edit files and save -- the browser updates automatically.

## Production setup

For production, use a real MongoDB and Redis instead of the default mocks:

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://... REDIS_URL=redis://... yarn start-production
```

Build first with `yarn build`, then run with `yarn start-production`.

## Why StartupJS?

- **Cross-platform** -- one codebase for web, iOS, and Android (built on Expo and React Native).
- **Real-time sync** -- data changes on one client appear instantly on all others.
- **Signals** -- reactive data pointers that automatically update your UI when data changes.
- **Built-in UI library** -- a full set of ready-to-use components designed for all platforms.
- **Zero setup database** -- MongoDB and Redis are mocked locally so you can start building immediately.

## How to use this tutorial

Each chapter builds on the previous one. Type the code yourself rather than copy-pasting -- you will learn faster and notice things you would otherwise miss. Experiment with changes to see what happens.

## Your first component

StartupJS apps are built from components. A component is a reusable piece of UI that bundles markup, styles, and behavior into one unit.

Here is the simplest possible component:

```jsx
import { observer } from 'startupjs'
import { Span } from 'startupjs-ui'

export default observer(function HelloWorld () {
  return (
    <Span>Hello, world!</Span>
  )
})
```

Every component that reads reactive data must be wrapped with `observer`. This tells StartupJS to re-render the component whenever the data it uses changes. You will see this pattern throughout the tutorial.
