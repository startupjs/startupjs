# Caching node_modules

If your CI or offline workflow benefits from caching dependencies, you can keep the Yarn cache inside your project and commit it.

## Steps

1. Disable the global Yarn cache so it writes to `.yarn/cache` in your repo:

```bash
yarn config set enableGlobalCache false
```

2. Make sure Git does not ignore the cache folder:

```bash
echo '!.yarn/cache' >> .gitignore
```

That is it. Your project now contains its own dependency cache.
