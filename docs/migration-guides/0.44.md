# Upgrade 0.42 to 0.43

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.43`.

## RELEASE NOTES

**No** breaking changes

Fix multiple `useValue` hook initialization at each rendering. Now the hook works like `useState` in react.

```js
const [value, $value] = useValue(Math.random())

return pug`
  Button(onPress=() => $value.set(value + 1)) Increment
`
```

In this example, the `value` did not increase when the button was clicked because the next initialization was performed with a new `Math.random()` value.
