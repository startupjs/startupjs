# Upgrade 0.60 to 0.61

- Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.61`
- Switch from using `@startupjs/ui` to `startupjs-ui` version `^0.1.6`

## Notable Changes

- Add offline support with persisting to local storage (web and
react-native). It's on by default when there is no server
(`features.enableServer: false` in `startupjs.config.js`).
- Remove `@startupjs/ui` - use `startupjs-ui` instead.
- Remove `mdx` and `docs`. Use `@startupjs-ui/mdx` and
`@startupjs-ui/docs` instead.

## Migration

All UI components were moved out into a separate package `startupjs-ui` with its
own monorepo: https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs-ui

1. in `package.json` change `"@startupjs/ui"` to `"startupjs-ui":
"^0.1.6"`

2. in the project make a global search on `@startupjs/ui` and change all
imports from `'@startupjs/ui'` to `'startupjs-ui'`

3. Change components `<H1>`-`<H6>` to `<Span h1>` - `<Span h6>` (make a
global search in the project on H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6)

4. Change component `<Row>` to `<Div row>` (make a global search in the
project on `Row`)

5. Change component `<Multiselect>` to `<MultiSelect>` (the name was
changed)

6. Upgrade `startupjs` and `expo` to the latest versions by manually
changing `"startupjs"` and `"expo"` to the latest ones, then do `yarn`
and then do `npx startupjs install --fix` to upgrade all dependencies.
