# Upgrade 0.37 to 0.38

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.38`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

### `startupjs/ui` additional dependencies

    ```
    yarn add react-native-collapsible@^1.6.0 react-native-color-picker@^0.6.0
    ```

- rename `onDateChange` to `onChangeDate`
- rename `minuteInterval` to `timeInterval`
- rename `format` to `dateFormat`

### `startupjs/ui/Popover`

The current API is deprecated, the difference with the new API:

- `hasArrow` property is renamed to `arrow`
- `hasWidthCaption` property is renamed to `matchAnchorWidth`
- `style` property is renamed to `attachmentStyle`
- `captionStyle` property is renamed to `style`
- the properties `hasDefaultWrapper`, `hasOverlay`, `animationType` are removed
- the component is now uncontrolled and you don't need to pas `visible` and `onDismiss` properties
- no need to use `Popover.Caption`, just pass trigger as popover children
- to render content use `renderContent` property instead of passing it as children of the popover
- there are no default paddings for content now (**IMPORTANT:** paddings were returned in version 40)

### `startupjs/ui/Tooltip`

- component is deprecated, instead use the `renderTooltip` of the `Div` component to render the tooltip

### `startupjs/ui/Collapse`

- the shadow of the component was removed

### `startupjs/ui/forms/*`

- All low-level inputs (`TextInput`, `Select`, etc.) are now pure and don't support `label`, `description`, `layout`. Using low-level inputs is now discouraged. Use `Input` everywhere which has support for `label`, `description`, `layout` and the 2-way bindings:

    1. `ArrayInput` -> `Input(type='array')`
    2. `Checkbox` -> `Input(type='checkbox')`
    3. `ColorPicker` -> `Input(type='color')`
    4. `DateTimePicker` -> `Input(type='date')` or `Input(type='time')` or `Input(type='datetime')`
    5. `Multiselect` -> `Input(type='multiselect')`
    6. `NumberInput` -> `Input(type='number')`
    7. `ObjectInput` -> `Input(type='object')`
    8. `PasswordInput` -> `Input(type='password')`
    9. `Radio` -> `Input(type='radio')`
    10. `Select` -> `Input(type='select')`
    11. `TextInput` -> `Input(type='text')`



### `startupjs/server`, `startupjs/backend`

- deny access to db by default. This is controlled with the flag `secure` (which is `true` by default) in the options of your startupjs server in `server/index.js`: `startupjsServer(options, ee => {})`.

    Specifying `secure: true` is the same as enabling all security options:

    ```js
    accessControl: true,
    serverAggregate: true,
    validateSchema: true
    ```

    If you currently only have some of this security options enabled, you can specify `secure: false` and explicitely set
    only the options you want. BUT it's strongly encouraged to keep `secure: true` and implement all 3 security options
    when migrating to `0.38` by following the according guides:

    - > [accessControl](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/sharedb-access)
    - > [serverAggregate](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/server-aggregate)
    - > [validateSchema](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/sharedb-schema)
