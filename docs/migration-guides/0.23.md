# Upgrade 0.22 to 0.23

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.23`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

1. Update babel, metro and webpack config files:

    1. Change their extensions to `.cjs`:
        - `babel.config.js` -> `babel.config.cjs`
        - `metro.config.js` -> `metro.config.cjs`
        - `webpack.server.config.js` -> `webpack.server.config.cjs`
        - `webpack.web.config.js` -> `webpack.web.config.cjs`

    2. change the `require` of bundler inside all of them to have an explicit `.cjs` extension:
        - `require('startupjs/bundler')` -> `require('startupjs/bundler.cjs')`

    3. add `.cjs` extension to the `'startupjs/babel'` preset in `babel.config.cjs`:

        - `'startupjs/babel'` -> `'startupjs/babel.cjs'`

        ```js
        module.exports = {
          presets: [
            ['startupjs/babel.cjs', {
              alias: {}
            }]
          ]
        }
        ```

2. Update startupjs config file:

    1. Change its extension to `.cjs`:
        - `startupjs.config.js` -> `startupjs.config.cjs`

    2. Update it's `require` of config to a new CJS file:
        - `require('@startupjs/ui/config')` -> `require('@startupjs/ui/config-cjs/index.cjs')`

3. Add `vite.config.cjs` file to your project root with the following content:

    ```js
    const config = require('startupjs/bundler.cjs').viteConfig
    module.exports = config
    ```

4. Update server:

    1. Change `server.js` to:
        ```js
        import run from './server/index.js'
        run()
        ```

    2. Add the following to the end of `server/index.js`:
        ```js
        export default function run () {}
        ```

5. Update `package.json`.

    1. Add after `"name"`:
        ```json
        "type": "module",
        "sideEffects": [],
        ```

    2. Change `postinstall` script to:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
            "postinstall": "startupjs patch-package"
        }
        ```

    3. Change `build` script to:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
            "build": "startupjs build --async"
        }
        ```

        Note that this will start building production bundle splitting all your components into separate chunks.
        You have to have `http2` enabled on your load-balancer and cache all your `.js` files to have this working correctly.

    4. Put `/* @asyncImports */` comment to the top of your `main/pages/index.js` and to all other frontend-microservices `*/pages/index.js` if you have any (like `admin/pages/index.js`, etc.)

        This will transform imports in this files to be asynchronous for production. Which will greatly improve the initial loading speed.

    5. Remove `postinstall-postinstall` and `patch-package` from your `devDependencies`

    6. Fix `react-native-web` version in dependencies to `0.12.3`:
        ```json
        "dependencies": {
            "react-native-web": "0.12.3"
        }
        ```

6. Delete `patches` folder completely.

7. Delete the file `clientHelpers/BASE_URL.web.js` if it exists.

8. If you have `react-native.config.js` file, change its extension to `.cjs`:
    - `react-native.config.js` -> `react-native.config.cjs`

9. Change hot-reloading library on web to Fast Refresh. This simplifies the hot reloading setup and gets rid of the extra end-user dependency `@hot-loader/react-dom`. End-users must update their projects to remove the `@hot-loader/react-dom` from their `package.json` and from the `Root/index.web.js` file.
