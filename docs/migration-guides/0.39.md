# Upgrade 0.38 to 0.39

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.39`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

### `startupjs/hooks`

- **useBind**: The default property was removed because it does not make any sense considering that it also worked incorrectly. If you used it then fix it by declaring the value manually after calling the hook.
