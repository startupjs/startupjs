# Upgrade 0.28 to 0.29

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.29`.

## BREAKING CHANGES
- **App**: remove deprecated `initUpdateApp` from `app/server`. Change `initUpdateApp` function to `initApp` function. [See more](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/app)

- **App**: restored support for critical versions of applications. They can now reactively notify users of a required update. `CRITICAL_VERSION` is now stored directly in DB. [See more](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/app)

- **Select**: changed deprecated `Picker` from `react-native` to `Picker` from `@react-native-picker/picker`. It also fixed error on Android with conditional rendering `Picker.Item` when using the `Select` property `showEmptyValue = {false}`. Need to install a new library `yarn add @response-native-picker/picker` from version 1.9.3 and above through the your package manager and pod for IOS.
