# Upgrade 0.28 to 0.29

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.29`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

- **Select**: changed deprecated `Picker` from `react-native` to `Picker` from `@react-native-picker/picker`. It also fixed error on Android with conditional rendering `Picker.Item` when using the `Select` property `showEmptyValue = {false}`. Need to install a new library `yarn add @response-native-picker/picker` from version 1.9.3 and above through the your package manager and pod for IOS.
