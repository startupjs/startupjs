# Upgrade 0.34 to 0.35

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.36`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

### `startupjs/ui/Breadcrumbs`
- no longer supports `Link` component properties for `route`

### `startupjs/ui/Badge`
- `size='s'` now shows content, if you don't want to show content, then use the `variant='dot'` property

### `typography/fonts`

- the structure of `$UI.fontFamilies` was changed. Now it accepts platform-specific keys `web`, `android`, `ios`, `windows`, `macos`, `native` to override fonts on a particular platform and one special key `default` to override fonts simultaneously for all platforms. If you are using fonts in your project then [see docs](https://startupjs-ui.dmapper.co/docs/foundation/Typography/Fonts#font-family) to understand how to migrate your config.
