# Upgrade 0.39 to 0.40

Change `startupjs` and all `@startupjs/*` dependencies in your `package.json` to `^0.40`.

## BREAKING CHANGES

Upgrade web client and server compilation in dev and in production from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5.

**Notes about how to upgrade to v0.40.0:**

1. You can't use named imports from `.json` files anymore. Instead import the whole json file and then do the manual destructuring:

  ```js
  // OLD
  import { BORDER_WIDTH, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY } from './constants.json'

  // NEW
  import CONSTANTS from './constants.json'
  const { BORDER_WIDTH, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY } = CONSTANTS
  ```

2. Webpack 5 changed the way it parses modules to use ESM modules wherever possible. Because of this some `default` imports from old CommonJS modules might be imported not directly but inside the `.default` field.

  If you receive errors from React that it can't render something because it received an `object` -- this probably means that you need to get your default import from `.default` field manually:

  ```js
  // OLD
  import DrawerLayout from 'react-native-drawer-layout-polyfill'

  // NEW
  import DrawerLayoutModule from 'react-native-drawer-layout-polyfill'
  const DrawerLayout = DrawerLayoutModule.default || DrawerLayoutModule
  ```

  Same goes for errors like `object is not a function` when your default import is actually expected to be a function. You'll have to do the same trick as above.
