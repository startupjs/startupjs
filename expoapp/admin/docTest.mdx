# Button

Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@startupjs/ui'
```

## Simple example

```jsx example
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

return (
  <Button onPress={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
    Clicked {counter} times
  </Button>
)
```

## Pug example

```jsx example
const $counter = $(0)

return pug`
  Button(onPress=() => $counter.increment())
    | Clicked #{$counter.get()} times (in Pug)
`
```
