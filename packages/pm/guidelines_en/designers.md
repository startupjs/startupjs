# Guidelines for Designers

## When you want to add a new task:

1. Just create a new Issue on GitHub.
2. After creation, it will automatically receive the `👽 New` status.
3. You'll see this new task in `👽 New` column in Project's `📅 𝙿𝙻𝙰𝙽𝙽𝙸𝙽𝙶` tab.
4. If your Team Lead or Project Manager asked to work on it this sprint (this or next week), then assign it to yourself and change its status to `ᴜx: 🎴 Todo`. Do it AFTER you have created the task itself - you will not be able to set status until you have actually created the task first.

## When you want to work on a new task:

1. Go to the `🧑 𝙼𝚈 𝚃𝙰𝚂𝙺𝚂` tab in the GitHub Project -- it will only show the tasks assigned to you.

2. If you don't see any tasks in `ᴜx: 🎴 Todo` section:

    - go to `🎨 𝚄𝚇` tab in the GitHub Project;
    - assign some tasks to yourself;
    - return back to `🧑 𝙼𝚈 𝚃𝙰𝚂𝙺𝚂` tab.

2. Estimate how long **each** task in `ᴜx: 🎴 Todo` section will take you to design:

    - Only think of the initial time for you to do the work, do NOT try to account for the review process.
    - Set the `Hours` value for the task (`🩵 𝟷ℎ`, `💚 𝟸ℎ`, `💛 𝟺ℎ`, `🧡 𝟾ℎ`).
    - This is the approximate number of hours to complete it. If the task is too large (more than 8 hours), set the `Hours` value to `💕 N` and break it down into smaller ones - a maximum of 8 hours each.
    - For breaking down tasks into smaller ones you can just create a checkbox list in the description of the task and specify amount of hours for each item at the end, for example:

        ```
        Design main navigation layout
        - [ ] topbar (4h)
        - [ ] sidebar (2h)
        - [ ] footer (2h)
        - [ ] mobile menu (2h)
        ```

        Only use the scale of `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h` - do NOT set arbitrary hours numbers.

3. Pick a task you are going to work on next from the `ᴜx: 🎴 Todo` section.

4. Change this task's status to `ᴜx: 🎨 In progress`.

5. When you are done working on this task, change its status to `ᴜx: 👀 On review` and ask other team members to review it.

6. When other team members approved your work on this task, change its status to `ᴜx: ✅ Ready to code`

7. That's it! The task is considered to be done by you at this point.
