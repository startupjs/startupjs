# Developers:

## When you want to add a new task:

1. Just create a new Issue on GitHub.
2. After creation, it will automatically receive the `👽 New` status.
3. You'll see this new task in `👽 New` column in Project's `📅 𝙿𝙻𝙰𝙽𝙽𝙸𝙽𝙶` tab.
4. If your Team Lead or Project Manager asked to work on it this sprint (this or next week), then assign it to yourself and change its status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo`. Do it AFTER you have created the task itself - you will not be able to set status until you have actually created the task first.

## When you want to work on a new task:

1. Go to the `🧑 𝙼𝚈 𝚃𝙰𝚂𝙺𝚂` tab in the GitHub Project -- it will only show the tasks assigned to you.

2. If you don't see any tasks in `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo` section:

    - go to `🚀 𝙳𝙴𝚅` tab in the GitHub Project;
    - assign some tasks to yourself;
    - return back to `🧑 𝙼𝚈 𝚃𝙰𝚂𝙺𝚂` tab.

3. Estimate how long **each** task in `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo` section will take you to code:

    - Only think of the initial time for you to do the work, do NOT try to account for the review process and bug fixing.
    - Set the `Hours` value for the task (`🩵 𝟷ℎ`, `💚 𝟸ℎ`, `💛 𝟺ℎ`, `🧡 𝟾ℎ`).
    - This is the approximate number of hours to complete it. If the task is too large (more than 8 hours), set the `Hours` value to `💕 N` and break it down into smaller ones - a maximum of 8 hours each.
    - For breaking down tasks into smaller ones you can just create a checkbox list in the description of the task and specify amount of hours for each item at the end, for example:

        ```
        Implement the main navigation layout
        - [ ] topbar (4h)
        - [ ] sidebar (2h)
        - [ ] footer (2h)
        - [ ] mobile menu (2h)
        ```

        Only use the scale of `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h` - do NOT set arbitrary hours numbers.

4. Pick a task you are going to work on next from the `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo` section.

5. Run command `yarn task <number>` to create a feature branch for it.

    - This will create a new feature branch which is literally named `<number>` -- the name of the branch is just the number of the task.
    - This will also automatically change task's status from `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo` to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🚀 In progress`.

    **Example:**

    if you are about to work on task number 1205, then run the command `yarn task 1205` -- this will either create a new branch from the latest master and change the task status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🚀 In progress`, or just switch to it if this branch already exists.

6. When you are done writing code and want it to be reviewed -- run `yarn pr` to create a Pull Request.

    - This command will convert your task from an github issue into a PR and push your current branch with the code into it.
    - It will automatically retrieve the issue number from the name of your current branch (which should be named after the task number).
    - This will also automatically change task's status from `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🚀 In progress` to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🔍 On review`
    - After that, to push changes to your PR, just do `git push` as usual.

7. When reviewers request some changes to be made:

    - The task will automatically change status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: ❤️ Changes requested`

    **IMPORTANT**: Reviewers must use [GitHub's 'request changes' feature](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request#submitting-your-review)

8. When you see that someone requested changes on your task:

    - Switch back to your task branch using `yarn task <number>`.
    - Make changes and push as usual with a simple `git push`.
    - When you want your code to be reviewed again, just run `yarn pr`.
    - This will request a review again and will automatically change the status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🔍 On review`.

9. After your PR has received the necessary minimum approvals (usually `2`), your task will automatically change status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: ✅ Ready to be merged`.

10. When your team lead merges the PR:

    - The task will automatically change its status to `ǫᴀ: 🛖 Merged. Test Dev`.

11. QA team tests your task in the dev environment.

12. If there any bugs to fix or improvements, you (or your PMs or Team Leads) should create new tasks to fix them.

13. That's it! The task is considered to be done by you at this point.

**IMPORTANT:** Use the commands `yarn task <number>` and `yarn pr` to speed up work with branches and pull requests. Read about their functionality below:

### `yarn task <number>`

Creates new feature branches and switches between them.

Performs the following actions in order:

1. Switches to `master`.
2. Pulls it to get the latest changes.
3. Checks if a branch `<number>` already exists:

    - if does NOT exist -- creates this branch and switches to it;
    - if already exists -- switches to it.

4. if task's status is `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🎁 Todo`, changes it to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🚀 In progress`

### `yarn pr`

Pushes code, creates a pull request from an issue (if it has not already been created), and adds reviewers (or requests a review from them again).

Performs the following actions in order:

1. pushes the code
2. takes the name of the branch you are currently in -- it should be named after the number of your task
3. checks if a PR has already been created for this branch

    - If not -- converts the issue with that number into a PR and adds reviewers
    - If there is -- re-requests the review

4. changes task's status to `ᴅᴇᴠ: 🔍 On review`

## When you review Pull Requests:
