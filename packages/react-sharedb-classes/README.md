# startupjs react-sharedb-classes

> Run `ShareDB` in `React` using Class syntax

## What it does

1. Brings real-time collaboration to React using [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb);
2. Uses [Racer](https://derbyjs.com/docs/derby-0.10/models) to add a `model`
   to your app to do any data manipulations;
3. The `model` acts as a global singleton state, so you can use it as a
   replacement for other state-management systems like `Redux` or `MobX`;
4. Makes the `render` reactive similar to how it's done in `MobX` --
   rerendering happens whenever any `model` data you used in `render`
   changes.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything if you are in a StartupJS project.

For instructions on standalone usage in a pure React project refer to [`react-sharedb` readme](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/tree/master/packages/react-sharedb#using-react-sharedb-in-a-pure-react-project)

## Requirements

```
react: 16.9 - 17
```

## Usage with Classes

### `@subscribe(cb)` HOC

`@subscribe` decorator is used to specify what you want to subscribe to.

`@subscribe` gives react component a personal local scope model, located at path `$components.<random_id>`.
This model will be automatically cleared when the component is unmounted.

### HOW TO: Subscribe to data and use it in render()

`@subscribe` accepts a single argument -- `cb`, which receives `props` and must return the `subscriptions object`.

Each `key` in the `subscriptions object` will fetch specified data from the MongoDB or a Local path and
will write it into the component's personal scope model under that `key`.

The read-only data of the component's model is available as `this.props.store`.
Use it to render the data you subscribed to, same way you would use `this.state`.

**IMPORTANT** As with `this.state`, the `this.props.store` **SHOULD NOT** be modified directly! Read below to find out how to modify data.

Example:

```js
import React from 'react'
import {subscribe, subLocal, subDoc, subQuery} from 'startupjs'

@subscribe(props => ({
  myUserId: subLocal('_session.userId'),
  room: subDoc('rooms', props.roomId)
}))
@subscribe(props => ({
  myUser: subDoc('users', props.store.userId),
  usersInRoom: subQuery('users', {_id: {
    $in: props.store.room && props.store.room.userIds || []
  }})
}))
export default class Room extends React.Component {
  render () {
    let {room, myUser, usersInRoom} = this.props.store
    return <Fragment>
      <h1>{room.name}</h1>
      <h2>Me: {myUser.name}</h2>
      <p>Other users in the room: {usersInRoom.map(user => user.name)}</p>
    </Fragment>
  }
}
```

As seen from the example, you can combine multiple `@subscribe` one after another.

### HOW TO: Modify the data you subscribed to

The actual scoped model of the component is available as `this.props.$store`.
Use it to modify the data. For the API to modify stuff refer to the [Racer documentation](https://derbyjs.com/docs/derby-0.10/models)

In addition, all things from `subscriptions object` you subscribed to are
available to you as additional scope models in `this.props` under names `this.props.$KEY`

Example:

```js
import React from 'react'
import {subscribe, subLocal, subDoc, subQuery} from 'startupjs'

@subscribe(props => ({
  room: subDoc('rooms', props.roomId)
}))
export default class Room extends React.Component {
  updateName = () => {
    let {$store, $room} = this.props
    $room.set('name', 'New Name')
    // You can also use $store to do the same:
    $store.set('room.name', 'New Name')
  }
  render () {
    let {room} = this.props.store
    return <Fragment>
      <h1>{room.name}</h1>
      <button onClick={this.updateName}>Update Name</button>
    </Fragment>
  }
}
```

## *\[Classes\]* `sub*()` functions

Use sub*() functions to define a particular subscription.

<a name="subDoc"></a>
### `subDoc(collection, docId)`

Subscribe to a particular document.
You'll receive the document data as `props.store.{key}`

`collection` \[String\] -- collection name. Required
`docId` \[String\] -- document id. Required

Example:

```js
@subscribe(props => ({
  room: subDoc('rooms', props.roomId)
}))
```

<a name="subQuery"></a>
### `subQuery(collection, query)`

Subscribe to the Mongo query.
You'll receive the docuents as an array: `props.store.{key}`
You'll also receive an array of ids of those documents as `props.store.{key}Ids`

`collection` \[String\] -- collection name. Required
`query` \[Object\] -- query (regular, `$count`, `$aggregate` queries are supported). Required

Example:

```js
@subscribe(props => ({
  users: subQuery('users', { roomId: props.roomId, anonymous: false })
}))
```

**IMPORTANT:** The scope model `${key}`, which you receive from subscription, targets
an the array in the local model of the component, NOT the global `collection` path.
So you won't be able to use it to efficiently update document's data. Instead you should manually
create a scope model which targets a particular document, using the id:

```js
let {usersInRoom, $store} = this.props.store
for (let user of usersInRoom) {
  $store.scope(`${collection}.${user.id}`).setEach({
    joinedRoom: true,
    updatedAt: Date.now()
  })
}
```

<a name="subLocal"></a>
### `subLocal(path)`

Subscribe to the data you already have in your local model by path.
You'll receive the data on that path as `props.store.{key}`

You will usually use it to subscribe to private collections like `_page` or `_session`.
This is very useful when you want to share the state between multiple components.

It's also possible to subscribe to the path from a public collection, for example when you
want to work with some nested value of a particular document you have already subscribed to.

Example:

```js
const TopBar = subscribe(props => ({
  sidebarOpened: subLocal('_page.Sidebar.opened')
}))({
  $sidebarOpened
}) =>
  <button
    onClick={() => $sidebarOpened.setDiff(true)}
  >Open Sidebar</button>

const Sidebar = subscribe(props => ({
  sidebarOpened: subLocal('_page.Sidebar.opened')
}))({
  store: {sidebarOpened}
}) =>
  sidebarOpened ? <p>Sidebar</p> : null
```

<a name="subValue"></a>
### `subValue(value)`

A constant value to assign to the local scoped model of the component.

`value` \[String\] -- value to assign (any type)

### *\[Classes\]* Example

Below is an example of a simple app with 2 components:
1. `Home` -- sets up my userId and renders `Room`
2. `Room` -- shows my user name ands lets user update it,
   shows all users which are currently in the room.

```js
// Home.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Room from './Room.jsx'
import {model, subscribe, subLocal, subDoc, subQuery} from 'startupjs'

// `subscribe` means that the data is reactive and gets dynamically updated
// whenever the data in MongoDB or in private collections gets updated.

@subscribe(props => ({
  // Subscribe to the path in a private collection `_session`.
  //
  // `private` collection means that the data does NOT get synced with MongoDB.
  // Data in these collections live only on the client-side.
  //
  // Collection is considered `private` when its name starts from `_` or `$`.
  //
  // Private collections like `_session` are used as a singleton client-only storage,
  // an alternative to `Redux` or `MobX`.
  //
  // You can have as many private collections as you like, but the common
  // guideline is to use just one collection to store all private data -- `_session`
  userId: subLocal('_session.userId')
}))

export default class Home extends React.Component {
  constructor (...props) {
    super(...props)

    // For each thing you subscribe to, you receive a scoped `model`
    // with the same name prefixed with `$` in `props`. Use it
    // to update the data with the `model` operations available in Racer:
    // https://derbyjs.com/docs/derby-0.10/models
    let {$userId} = this.props

    // Update the private path `_session.userId` with the new value
    //
    // We'll use this `_session.userId` in all other children
    // components to easily get the userId without doing the potentially
    // heavy/long process of fetching the userId over and over again.
    $userId.set(this.getUserId())
  }

  // Get my userId somehow (for example from the server-side response).
  // For simplicity, we'll just generate a random guid in this example
  // by creating an empty user document each time, so whenever
  // you open a new page, you'll be a new user.
  getUserId = () => model.add('users', {})

  render = () => <Room roomId={'myCoolRoom1'} />
}
```

```js
// Room.jsx
import React from 'react'
import {model, subscribe, subLocal, subDoc, subQuery} from 'startupjs'

@subscribe(props => ({

  // Subscribe to the same private path again to get the userId, which
  // we did manually setup in the parent `<Home>` component.
  // The pattern of subscribing and updating data in a private path
  // can be used to expose some data from one component to another.
  userId: subLocal('_session.userId'),

  // Subscribe to the particular document from a public collection `rooms` by id.
  // `public` means that it DOES sync with MongoDB.
  // `public` collection names start with a regular letter a-z.
  // You can also use ClassCase for collection names (A-Z), but it is
  // NOT recommended unless you have such guidelines in your project.
  room: subDoc('rooms', props.roomId)

}))

// All things you subscribe to end up in `props.store` under the same name.
// We can do a second subscribe using the data we received in the first one.

@subscribe(props => ({

  // Subscribe to the particular document from a public collection by id
  // which we got from the previous subscription
  myUser: subDoc('users', props.store.userId),

  // Subscribe to a query to get docs from a public `users` collection
  // using the array of userIds from `room` received in the previous subscription
  users: subQuery('users', {_id: {
    $in: props.store.room && props.store.room.userIds || []
  }})

}))

// Additionally, whenever you subscribe to the MongoDB query, you also
// receive the `Ids` in store.
// For example, subscribing to the `users` collection above populated
// `props.store.users` (array of documents) AND
// `props.store.userIds` (array of ids) - auto singular name with the `Ids` suffix

export default class Room extends React.Component {
  constructor (...props) {
    super(...props)
    let {$room, roomId} = this.props
    let {userId, room, room: {userIds = []}} = this.props.store

    // Create an empty room if it wasn't created yet
    if (!room) model.add('rooms', {id: roomId, title: `Room #${roomId}`})

    // Add user to the room unless he's already there
    if (!userIds.includes(userId)) $room.push('userIds', userId)
  }

  changeName = (event) => {
    let {$myUser} = this.props
    $myUser.setEach({name: event.target.value})
  }

  render () {
    let { myUser, room, users, userId } = this.props.store
    return (
      <main>
        <h1>{room.title}</h1>
        <section>
          My User Name:
          <input type='text' value={myUser.name} onChange={this.changeName} />
        </section>
        <h3>Users in the room:</h3>
        {
          users
          .filter(({id}) => id !== userId) // exclude my user
          .map(user =>
            <section key={user.id}>
              {user.name || `User ${user.id}`}
            </section>
          )
        }
      </main>
    )
  }
}
```
