# Item

Item is a basic component that is a wrapper over the content with the ability to position it and the ability to display an icon or image.

## Simple example

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item Example
`
```

## Icon

The icon can be added using the `icon` property, which will be displayed on the left side of the component.

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item(icon=faTrashAlt) Icon
`
```

## Image

The image can be added using the `url` property, which will be displayed on the left side of the component. The `url` property takes precedence over the `icon` property if both are passed.

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item(url="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/95/30/41/953041070f000d45c05c912005f63724.jpg") Image
`
```

## Item as link

By passing the url to the `to` property, the component will behave like a link.

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item(to='/docs/components/Icon') Icon component
`
```

## Actions

Passed handler to `onPress` property will be called when the user taps the component.

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item(onPress=()=> alert('click')) Click me
`
```

## Advanced usage

Item consists of three parts - `Left`, `Content` and `Right`. These parts can be used to add custom markup, where:

- `Left` part is used instead of `icon` and `url` properties and inserts its content into the left side of the component.

- `Content` part is used instead of `children` and inserts its content between `Left` and `Right` parts.

- `Right` part inserts its content into the right side of the component.

```jsx example
return pug`
  Item(onPress=()=> alert('click'))
    Item.Left
      Image(
        style={ width: u(3), height: u(3) }
        source={ uri: 'https://i.pinimg.com/736x/95/30/41/953041070f000d45c05c912005f63724.jpg' }
      )
    Item.Content
      Span Content
    Item.Right
      Icon(icon=faShareAlt)
`
```
