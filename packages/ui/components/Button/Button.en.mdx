# Button

Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@startupjs/ui'
```

## Example

```jsx example
const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)
return (
  <Button onPress={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
    Clicked {counter} times
  </Button>
)
```

## Call to Action

Try to keep the variety of button combinations you use in your app to the minimum.

Use regular Button without any options by default. Whenever you want to emphasize a particular `Call-to-Action`, use a primary flat button.

```jsx example
<Button color='primary' variant='flat'>
  Destroy the Death Star!
</Button>
```

## Colors

The `color` property is 'dark' by default. It can be changed by changing `color` prop. Possible values of property can be found in the Sandbox section at the bottom of the page.

The icon color can be set by specifying the color name from $ UI.colors.

The `variant` property is responsible for the external display of the button (affects the color of the icon and button text). The `variant` property is `outlined` by default.

In `.styl` file
```stylus
.icon
  color $UI.colors.success
```

```jsx example
return (
  <Div>
    <Button>
      Default
    </Button>
    <Br />
    <Button color='primary' variant='flat' size='s'>
      Color and Variant
    </Button>
    <Br />
    <Button color='success' iconStyleName='icon' icon={faCheck} size='xl'>
      Button with Icon
    </Button>
  </Div>
)
```

## Size

The `size` property applies to the button size, the icon and text of the button.
The `size` property is `m` by default. It can be changed by changing `size` prop. Possible values of property can be found in the `Sandbox` section at the bottom of the page.

```jsx example
return (
  <Div>
    <Button variant='flat' size='s' icon={faCheck}>
      Small
    </Button>
    <Br />
    <Button variant='flat' icon={faCheck}>
      Default
    </Button>
    <Br />
    <Button variant='flat' size='l' icon={faCheck}>
      Large
    </Button>
  </Div>
)
```

## Buttons order

Whenever specifiying several buttons on one line, stick to the order of buttons which people are used to from various OS'es. `Cancel` should be first, and then `OK`.

Never put multiple `Call-to-Action` buttons in one component. And try to keep the amount of them visible at the same time on one page to the minimum.

It's a much better UX decision to use regular buttons by default and decide which of them to make a `Call-to-Action` later.

```jsx example
<Row align='right'>
  <Button>
    Cancel
  </Button>
  <Button pushed color='primary' variant='flat'>
    OK
  </Button>
</Row>
```

## Sandbox

<Sandbox Component={Button} />
