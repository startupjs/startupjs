# What is StartupJS

StartupJS is a cross-platform full stack framework for building reactive applications within minutes. From the name itself, you can understand that the main idea of this product is to simplify the creation of your startup. It often happens that there is an idea and you want to implement it now while it is still relevant, but then you face a heavy stack of technologies that need to be mastered to create any viable application. And if you need some more specific functionality, then the idea can simply sink into oblivion. This is because you often have to seek developers, explain the idea to them and it is not a given that they will form an image similar to yours. This is the moment of StartupJS to come into play, since it is enough for you to know javaScript and React to create a prototype for your startup and it will be reactive, cross-platform and adaptive. Moreover, there is an out-of-the-box library of high-quality UI components to allow you to build your application just like a Lego constructor.

## How to use the course

You need to have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to understand StartupJS.

As you progress through the course, you will come across mini-exercises to illustrate library capabilities. The following modules are based on the knowledge discussed earlier, so it is recommended to study StartupJS in chapter order.

Each chapter of the tutorial will have a 'Show me' button, which you can click, if you have difficulties while doing tasks. Try to use it as little as possible. You will learn faster if you understand where needed block of code should be inserted to and type it yourself in the editor. So try to write the code at every stage yourself. It is also a great practice to come up with something of your own to put the acquired skills to a test. For example, assume that there is a module about a button handler in which you are given a task of implementing a button with the specified functionality. Try to think about how you would use this button in your own project, what functionality you would require, and try to implement it within the sandbox. This approach allows you to understand how one or the other component actually works instead of simply memorizing it.

## Application structure

Since StartupJS is based on React, the approach to development is component-based. It means that an application consists of one or more components. A component is a reusable, stand-alone block of code that isolates markup, styles, and behavior that are coupled together.

Look at the ‘Hello, world!’ example in the code editor, this is how a simple component looks like.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { observer } from 'startupjs'
import { H1 } from '@startupjs/ui'

export default observer(function FirstExample () {
  return(
    <H1>
      Hello, world!
    </H1>
  )
})
```

## Why StarpupJS?

StartupJS provides you with an independent system for building custom applications. There is no necessity to have a thorough knowledge of how to make the server work, how to organize the interaction with the database or how to display it to the user. StartupJS has useful and quick components to implement each of these steps.

If you choose StartupJS, you get an application that works on web, ios, android platforms in the same reactive way.
