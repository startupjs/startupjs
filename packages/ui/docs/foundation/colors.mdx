# Colors

## Overview

StartupJS colors provide a comprehensive set of semantically named variables designed to ensure visual coherence and maintain semantic meaning across all digital interfaces. This documentation outlines the usage of the colors object, which includes base colors and their derivatives categorized for shadows, text, backgrounds, borders, and text on various backgrounds. Each color variable is named to indicate its intended use, aiding in maintaining consistency and ease of understanding for developers and designers when applying the color system. StartupJS also provides an [API](./colorCustomization) to integrate custom color palette or override specific colors.

## Usage guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Always use color variables instead of hardcoded values to ensure consistency across the interface and facilitate theming or rebranding.
2. **Semantics**: Use colors according to their semantic meaning as defined in this documentation to maintain a coherent user experience.

## Using color variables in styles

To use these color variables in your styles, refer to them with the `var` function - `var(--color-${COLOR_NAME})`. This allows you to apply the dynamic values of the color variables to your styles.

```styl
.card
  background-color var(--color-bg-main)
  border-color var(--color-border-main)

.text
  color var(--color-text-main)
```
## Using color variables in JavaScript

```js
import { useColors } from '@startupjs/ui'

const getColor = useColors()
const bgColor = getColor('bg-main')
```

## Colors(Palette)

```jsx pure-example nostyle
const { COLOR_TYPES } = CONSTANTS

return pug`
  ColorList(items=COLOR_TYPES)
`
```
