# E2E Testing in StartupJS

StartupJS utilizes the **Playwright** tool for writing E2E (End-to-End) tests. Below are the steps to get started with Playwright in your project.

## Installing Playwright

To start working with Playwright, you need to install it in your project's repository. Execute the following command:

```bash
yarn create playwright
```

## Generating Tests with Playwright

To launch the test generator, use the command:

```bash
yarn playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```

The result will be recorded in the `tests` folder.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the command:

```bash
yarn playwright test
```

## CI Integration

For an example of integrating Playwright with CI using GitHub Actions, refer to the [workflows/run-tests.yaml](https://github.com/startupjs/startupjs/blob/master/.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml) file in the StartupJS repository.
