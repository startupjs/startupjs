# startupjs bundler
> Opinionated scripts and configs to develop a react-native-web project

## Requirements

```
react-native-svg: >= 12.1.0
```

## Usage

TBD

## Async chunks support

Pass `ASYNC=1` env var when building to enable the asynchronous chunks
support. This will make each node module from `/node_modules/`
and each component from the `/components/` folder to be its own small chunk
loaded asynchronously.

This is useful when you are using dynamic `import()` in your code.

When the `ASYNC=1` is passed, the files with the extension `.async.js`
will take priority over the plain `.js` files. This enables you
to move the asynchronous dynamic `import()` statements into their own files.

Duplicating your dependencies in `.js` and `.async.js` files enables
you to have your codebase running in environments which don't
support the dynamic `import()` yet, for example the react-native Metro builder.

Your production server must have HTTP/2 support, otherwise you'll have a connection
limit of around 6 connections per hostname and you will notice your website
loading VERY SLOOOOW in production (if you set the Network Throttling to `Slow 3G`).

If you use Google Load Balancer and serve your content through HTTPS, then you
already have the HTTP/2 enabled without having to handle HTTP/2 in your Node.js app:

## Export from stylus and css files

We can export variables directly from stylus into js. Here is an example:

1. In `ShoppingCart/index.styl` file:

```styl
// allow overrides from global configuration
$this = merge({
  bgColor: $UI.colors.primary,
  height: 10u
}, $UI.ShoppingCart, true)

.root
  height: $this.height
  background-color: $this.bgColor

:export
  config: $this
  colors: $UI.colors
  foobar: 42
```

2. Now import variables `colors`, `config` and `foobar` in the `ShoppingCart/index.js` file:

```jsx
import STYLES from './index.styl'

const {
  config: { bgColor },
  colors,
  foobar
} = STYLES

export default function ShoppingCart () {
  console.log('Background color is:', bgColor)
  console.log('Available colors:', colors)
  console.log('Magic number FooBar:', foobar)
  return <View styleName='root' />
}
```
